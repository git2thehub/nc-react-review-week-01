// what is the DOM?
// Document Object Model
// the structure of your website organized in a document object structure
// view source vs inspect
// is inspect the dom? no - technically it is an HTML representation of the dom, it is made to look like HTML even though it is the current dom structure that is on your page
// 1. the browser gets HTML 
// 2. it parses it
// 3. and it turns it into an object (that object is the structure of your site)

// read - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction
// Document, Node, Element
// the object gives you access to document.getElementById or document.querySelector (there is a large list)
// view properties in CDT
// you can add remove modify elements in real time and the DOM is not the HTML served but what the browser sees as the current state of your HTML and you can manipulate it because of the DOM
